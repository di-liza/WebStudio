## Features

1. **Responsive Design**: This website is built with a responsive layout, ensuring it looks and functions well on various devices and screen sizes.

2. **BEM Methodology**: We follow the BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) methodology for naming classes in HTML and CSS, which helps maintain a structured and organized codebase.

3. **Flexbox Layout**: We utilize the Flexbox layout model to create flexible and efficient page layouts, making it easier to align and distribute elements on the site.

## Usage
